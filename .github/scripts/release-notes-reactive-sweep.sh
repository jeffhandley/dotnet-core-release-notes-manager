#
# Hourly reactive sweep for the Release Notes Manager. pull_request_review does
# not fire for draft PRs, and an issue_comment trigger is too noisy (it runs on
# every comment across the repo), so instead the manager polls. This script:
#
#   1. lists open DRAFT release-notes PRs ([release-notes] title, release-notes/ head)
#   2. inspects each PR's reviews, review comments, replies, and issue comments
#      for human feedback that has not yet been processed (no :eyes: reaction
#      from the workflow actor)
#   3. leaves a :eyes: reaction on each newly-seen comment as a processed marker
#   4. emits a JSON array of the PR heads that have unprocessed feedback to stdout
#
# The manager maps each emitted head to a discovery target and dispatches the
# matching producer. Already-marked comments are skipped next hour, so a PR only
# triggers a producer run when new feedback has arrived.
#
# Requires: gh (GH_TOKEN), jq. Usage: release-notes-reactive-sweep.sh
